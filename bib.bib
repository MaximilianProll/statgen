	Abstract = {Folklore has it that a very simple supervised classification rule, based on the typically false assumption that the predictor variables are independent, can be highly effective, and often more effective than sophisticated rules. We examine the evidence for this, both empirical, as observed in real data applications, and theoretical, summarising explanations for why this simple rule might be effective. /// La tradition veut qu'une r{\`e}gle tr{\`e}s simple assumant l'independance des variables pr{\'e}dictives, une hypoth{\`e}se fausse dans la plupart des cas, peut {\^e}tre tr{\`e}s efficace, souvent m{\^e}me plus efficace qu'une m{\'e}thode plus sophistiqu{\'e}e en ce qui concerne l'attribution de classes a un groupe d'objects. A ce sujet, nous examinons les preuves empiriques, observ{\'e}es sur des donn{\'e}es r{\'e}elles, et les preuves th{\'e}oriques, c'est-a-dire les raisons pour lesquelles cette simple r{\`e}gle pourrait faciliter le processus de tri.},

@article{Cortes1995,
	Abstract = {Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},
